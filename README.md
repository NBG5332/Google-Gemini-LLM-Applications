# Google-Gemini-LLM-Applications
Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Google's Gemini Pro LLM has shown remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. This research paper explores the effective utilization of Gemini Pro LLM across diverse applications, demonstrating its potential to reduce workloads and achieve great results in less time. Through the development of several Python applications, we investigate the integration of Gemini Pro LLM with Streamlit, a powerful tool for building interactive web applications. The paper presents methodologies and implementation details for tasks such as PDF question answering, resume evaluation, health view on food analysis, YouTube video transcript summarization and chat with video, and text to SQL query generation. Evaluation results and insights are provided, highlighting the challenges, best practices, and future opportunities in leveraging LLMs for NLP applications. These applications exemplify the transformative potential of LLMs in optimizing information retrieval and analysis workflows, promising enhanced productivity, and effectiveness in various domains.
